/**
    To customize the response for a failed authentication, we can implement an
    AuthenticationEntryPoint. Its commence() method receives the
    HttpServletRequest,the HttpServletResponse, and the AuthenticationException that
    cause the authentication to fail.
    NOTE Itâ€™s a little ambiguous that the name of the AuthenticationEntryPoint 'interface'
    does not reflect its usage on authentication failure.
    In the Spring Security architecture, this is used directly by a component called
    ExceptionTranslationManager, which handles any AccessDeniedException and AuthenticationException thrown within the filter chain.
    You can view the ExceptionTranslationManager as a bridge between Java
    exceptions and HTTP responses.
